# Project Outline

<h3> Project Overview </h3>

The project seeks to utilise both imaging data and routinely collected NHS clinical data to develop a model to predict stroke outcome and to support clinicians in making decisions regarding treatment options. 

<h3> Work Plan </h3> 

1. Apply data mapping to both routinely collected NHS clinical data and imaging data in order to develop a dataset which is curated to enable data scientist professionals to develop AI software for clinical applications. 
2. Definite condition, treatment and outcome coding to facilitate the development of models for outcome prediction by non-clinical professionals.
